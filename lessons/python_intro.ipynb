    "# Python and Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Python! Python is a high-level, object oriented, interpreted language that focuses on being user-friendly at the cost of performance and speed. At the same time, Python has great support for using different libraries, and many of these libraries _are_ capable of achieving good performance. In this course, we're going to learn how to use Python and its libraries to perform data analysis on large datasets, and present the results in an intuitive and meaningful way. Until we plot data, they're just floating point numbers sitting on a disk, so we want to make sense out them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help us do this, we're going to make use of Jupyter Notebooks (like the one you're reading now). Jupyter is a common framework for several different languages (\"Jupyter\" was originally an acronym-ish of \"Julia, Python, and R\") and an excellent way to combine running code, description, and plots all into one package. Jupyter lets you write Python code and execute it in an interactive fashion, and share your results in an easy and straightforward way. Jupyter notebooks are an industry-standard way of exploring and sharing data in the Data Science community, and are flexible and easily adapted. But enough talk, let's dig in!"

    "## Jupyter Notebook Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks have two kinds of cells: \"code\" and \"markdown\". \"Code\" are live code blocks that can be executed by hitting the \"Run\" button in the bar, or by hitting \"Shift + Enter\" on the keyboard. \"Markdown\" cells contain text input, which can be formatted as text, bulleted lists, code, and even LaTeX for typeset mathematics. We'll make use of all of these types in the examples below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executing Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The code cells in Jupyter notebooks can be executed and print output directly to the notebook. This output can be text or even figures. To execute code, the Jupyter notebook needs to spawn a _kernel_, which is a background task that handles all of the actual execution. You can still view Jupyter notebooks even without a kernel, which makes them useful for sharing data and results. But to do any live execution, a kernel is required. This kernel can either run locally, on your own machine, or on a remote computing cluster, where the Jupyter notebook is running in your browser window but executing code elsewhere. This approach makes notebooks very flexible and powerful."

    "Python is an _interpreted_ language, which means that it does not need to be compiled before it can be run. As a trade-off, this makes it slower than a compiled language, but we can make use of high-performance libraries to recoup some of these losses for performance-critical code. But to start out, we'll begin with some of the basics of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a _dynamically typed_ language, which means that variable types are determined at runtime. An implication of this is that variable types do not need to be declared before they are used. The interpreter will determine the type of objects as it encounters them and adjust accordingly. Python is also a _strongly typed_ language, which means that once variable types are determined, there are well-defined rules for how operations between them behave. In particular, Python does relatively little type coercion to get disparate types to work for a given operation. Instead, the programmer can explicitly _cast_ objects to different types if needed. This involved calling a function, like `int` on a datatype or variable to convert its type.\n",
